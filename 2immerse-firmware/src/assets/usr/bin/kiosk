  # Note: --disable-web-security stops Chromium prompting for use of the web camera
  # Note: --allow-running-insecure-content stops Chromium complaining about mixed http/https requests
  # Note: --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required subverts the autoplay policy introduced in Chrome 66
  # Note: --no-sandbox seems to be needed to fix issues with some chrome/kernel version combinations
  # Note: --start-fullscreen works just as well, if not better than specifying screen size
